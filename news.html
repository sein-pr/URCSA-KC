                    Christian Youth Ministry wins choir competition
                </h1>
                <p class="news-cont">Conductor Manuel Sasindere led his choir from the Christian Youth Ministry to 
                    victory at the Shabbach Clash Choir Competition on Saturday, and earned a cash prize of N$1500 and a floating trophy. 
                    The competition was aimed at uplifting the spirits of the youth, showcasing three competing choirs, after three others withdrew from the contest.
                    The inaugural event was hosted at Freedom Square in  Windhoek.  “I am excited, thrilled and overwhelmed with joy. 
                    Winning this competition has made me believe in my choir. During practice, it is often hard to gauge our true potential, but this victory has shown us just how far we have come,” he said. 
                    The choir, which has its roots embedded in the community, was formed around the 1990s. Originally a church group, the choir's mission was to spread the gospel through music.
