                    1The word of the Lord came to me:  2“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: 
                    “This is what the Lord says: “ ‘I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown. 3Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,’ ”

                    declares the Lord. 4 Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob, all you clans of Israel. 5This is what the Lord says: “What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. 6They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, a land of drought and utter darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?’ 7 I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce.

                        <li>God's Remembrance: The Lord reminds the people of Jerusalem about their early devotion. Picture God recalling their love, like a bride's love, as they journeyed together through the wilderness. How do you think God feels when longing for his children’s commitment to Him? </li>
                        <li>Straying: God questions why the people – his people – strayed and followed worthless idols. Think about times when you might have been tempted away from God's path. What can we learn from their mistake of turning away from the Lord? </li>
                        <li>Land Defiled: God brought them into a fertile land, but they defiled it with their actions. Consider the consequences of not appreciating the blessings God provides. How can we ensure that we don't defile the good things God gives us? </li>
                        <li>Leadership Failures: The leaders, priests, and those who dealt with the law did not seek or know the Lord. Reflect on the importance of spiritual leadership. How can leaders influence the direction of a community, positively or negatively? </li>
                        <li>Idolatry's Consequences: God compares the people's idolatry to nations changing their gods. Imagine the heavens being appalled by such actions. How does this metaphor help us understand the seriousness of idolatry? </li>
                        <li>The Sins of the People: God points out the sin of forsaking Him, the spring of living water, and relying on broken reservoirs. Reflect on the imagery of living water and broken cisterns. How does relying on God compare to relying on things that cannot sustain us? </li>
