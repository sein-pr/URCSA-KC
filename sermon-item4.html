                <p id="excerpt">
                    In John 5:1-15, the passage describes the healing of a man who had been paralyzed for 38 years. 
                    Jesus visits the Pool of Bethesda, where many sick people gathered, hoping for healing when the waters were stirred. 
                    He notices the man and asks if he wants to be healed. The man explains his struggle to reach the pool, as others always get there before him....
                    <span id="more" class="read-more">Read more</span>
                </p>
                <p id="full-text" class="full-text">
                    As John recounts the story, he notices Jesus arriving at the pool.
                    Jesus spots a man who has been paralyzed for 38 long years, an incredibly poignant detail that John emphasizes to illustrate the man’s profound suffering.
                    John watches as Jesus approaches the man and poses a seemingly simple question: “Do you want to be healed?” The man responds by sharing his struggle to reach the water, revealing a deep sense of hopelessness and isolation. 
                    John captures the man’s vulnerability in this moment, highlighting the despair that has defined his life.
                    Then, John witnesses the moment of transformation. 
                    Jesus commands the man, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” 
                    Immediately, the man obeys, rising to his feet and walking away. 
                    John marvels at the power of Jesus’ words, recognizing this miracle as a profound demonstration of divine authority.
                    <br/><br/>
                    However, John also sees the tensions that arise from this healing. 
                    The miracle takes place on the Sabbath, prompting the Jewish religious leaders to confront the man as he carries his mat. 
                    They question him about breaking their laws, illustrating the rigid interpretation of the Sabbath that John has seen time and again.
                    The man explains that it was Jesus who healed him, which only adds to the friction between Jesus and the religious authorities. 
                    Later, John observes Jesus finding the man in the temple. 
                    Jesus advises him to “stop sinning, or something worse may happen.” Here, John perceives a deeper message—Jesus not only brings physical healing but also emphasizes the importance of spiritual well-being.

                <h3>Thinks</h3>
                <div class="thinks-item">
                    <ul>
                        <li>T A Place of Need: Jesus choose to visit the pool near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem on purpose. 
                            What does it tell us about His care for those in desperate situations? </li>
                        <li> Enduring Suffering: The man by the pool had been sick for 38 years. How often do we find 
                            ourselves waiting for a change, yearning for healing, but facing seemingly insurmountable 
                            obstacles?</li>
                        <li> Surprising Question: Jesus asks the man, "Do you want to get well?" This is an obvious question, 
                            but Jesus asks it to prepare the man for receiving God’s grace. What does this reveal about the role 
                            of our own willingness in receiving healing? </li>
                        <li>Challenging Traditions: The healing happened on the Sabbath, leading to controversy. How does 
                            this incident challenge our views on rules and religious traditions and what does it reveal about 
                            Jesus' perspective on compassion and divine intervention?</li>
                        <li> Discovering Identity: The healed man didn't initially know who Jesus was. How often do we 
                            encounter Christ in unexpected places, and what impact does it have on our understanding of faith?</li>
                        <li>A Serious Message: Jesus warned the man about sin, suggesting that spiritual healing is also 
                            important. What does this mean for us, and how does it connect with the theme of healing in our 
                            lives?</li>
