                <p id="excerpt">
                    In Mark 8:34-38, Jesus addresses a crowd along with His disciples, presenting profound teachings about discipleship. This moment occurs after significant events in His ministry, where He begins to prepare His followers for the challenges they will face.
                    The atmosphere is charged with anticipation and perhaps confusion, as Jesus speaks about the cost of following Him.....

                <p id="full-text" class="full-text">
                    Jesus begins by calling anyone who wishes to be His disciple to “deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.” 
                    This statement is radical and challenging. John, observing this, notes that Jesus emphasizes the need for self-denial as a fundamental aspect of true discipleship.
                    Taking up one’s cross symbolizes embracing suffering, sacrifice, and the burdens that come with following Christ. 
                    John recognizes that this teaching contrasts sharply with worldly views that prioritize self-preservation and comfort.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Next, Jesus presents a paradox: “For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.” 
                    John reflects on how this statement challenges conventional wisdom. 
                    It suggests that true fulfillment and life come not from clinging to earthly desires but from surrendering oneself to Jesus and His mission.
                    John understands that Jesus is calling for a radical reorientation of priorities, where allegiance to Him takes precedence over personal gain.
                    Jesus further questions the value of worldly gain: “What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?” 
                    John perceives the weight of this question, recognizing that material success is meaningless if it comes at the cost of one’s spiritual integrity and eternal destiny.
                    The follow-up question, “What can anyone give in exchange for their soul?” deepens the conversation. 
                    John notes that no earthly possession can compare to the worth of a soul, highlighting the eternal significance of one’s choices.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Finally, Jesus delivers a sobering warning: “If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them.” 
                    John observes that Jesus acknowledges the cultural challenges His followers will face. In a world often opposed to His teachings, standing firm in faith can be difficult.
                    This statement underscores the importance of public acknowledgment of Jesus and His teachings. John realizes that Jesus desires a relationship based on trust and courage, even amidst societal pressure.

                        <li>Denying Personal Desires: Jesus calls the crowd and His disciples to be His followers. Discipleship 
                        requires a willingness to deny personal desires and take up the cross. How many Christians can truly 
                        say that they have done this? How easily do we cling onto what is easy and comfortable? </li>
                        <li> Embracing Sacrifice and Valuing the Soul: Choosing to hold tightly to our lives results in losing 
                            them, but surrendering to Jesus and the gospel leads to true preservation. Simultaneously, Jesus 
                            highlights the unmatched worth of the soul. Earthly gains lose significance when compared to the 
                            soul's value. What does it practically mean to sacrifice for Jesus, gaining a richer spiritual life? How 
                            can we shift our focus from material wealth to safeguarding our spiritual well-being? </li>
                        <li>  Shame: Jesus warns against shame over Him and His words. Shame before Him may lead to 
                            reciprocal shame when He comes in His Father's glory with the holy angels. How can we resist the 
                            temptation to be ashamed of Jesus in a world that often opposes His principles? </li>
