                <h2>The Church</h2>
                <p>The Church of Jesus Christ is the community of believers who are called together by the Word of
                    God and by His <em>Holy Spirit</em>. Those who have been called and who have been called and who form
                    <q>Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa</q>  are part of this Church of Christ. Together with all
                    the other churches who confess Christ, this church has been set apart as a nation; as the people
                    of God who belong to him and who have to proclaim the saving deeds of Him who called them
                    from darkness unto light; as a new creation who lives in the light as He is the light.
