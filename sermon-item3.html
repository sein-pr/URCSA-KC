                    4 The word of the Lord came to me, saying, 5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” 6 “Alas, Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am too young.” 7 But the Lord said to me, ...

                        <li>Being Set Apart: Jeremiah was set apart and appointed by God as a prophet. What does it mean to be set apart by God, and how might that apply to our lives? </li>
